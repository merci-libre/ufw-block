Simple and effective blocking tool for ufw.
Got tired of having to type in ip's for ufw manually every time, and then reloading the firewall
so i made this. 

Some notes: the ip formatter inside of the script is very buggy, and that's because I reused it from some other guy in one of my old scripts.

I honestly don't care that it doesn't catch ALL errors, just that it catches the initial letter being a string.
If you want to change that, go ahead.

- May or may not implement fail2ban integration, or use abuseIPDB to create an auto-block feature.
- If I do decide to do that, I will update on here and then also publish the full script on here as well.
- That may be written in python.
